    <h1>A POEM ABOUT A BOY CALLED TIM</h1>
    <h4>Formally illustrated from Adam to Tim during childhood</h4>

    <div id="line1">
        <p>I had a little brother,<br> his name was Tiny Tim,<br>
        I put him in the bathtub <br>to teach him how to swim;</p>
    </div>

        <p>He drank up all the water, <br>he ate up all the soap,<br>
        He died last night <br>with a bubble in his throat.</p>


    <p>In came the doctor, <br>in came the nurse,<br>
    In came the lady <br>with the alligator purse;</p>
    

    <p>Dead said the doctor, <br>dead said the nurse,<br>
    Dead said the lady <br>with the alligator purse;</p>

    <p>Out went the doctor, <br>out went the nurse,<br>
    Out went the lady <br>with the alligator purse;</p>
